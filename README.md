# pgomap-hacks

This is a hacky set of PHP scripts for doing things with the
[PokemonGo-map](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map) database
information.

NOTE: These are really hacky and not really supported. Use them if you want,
or if you find them useful, but don't expect much in the way of support for
them.
